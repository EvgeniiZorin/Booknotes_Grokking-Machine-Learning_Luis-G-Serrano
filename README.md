# Booknotes_Grokking-Machine-Learning_Luis-G-Serrano

In the file `notes_and_mistakes.ipynb` you can find my thoughts on different parts of the books, the mistakes I have found, and the implementation of different algorithms used in the book, wherever it differed from the one given in the book. 

## My opinion on the book

### Positive aspects

✅ I think this book is the best ML book for an absolute beginner to learn about ML and build strong intuition. Albeit I am no longer a beginner in ML, this book would be a perfect recommendation for someone who is about to begin their journey with ML and wants to build a strong intuition and understanding of how different ML algorithms work.

✅ For people experienced in ML, this book is still useful to improve their intuition about how various ML algorithms work. 

✅ The exercises given at the end of each chapter are a good way to review some basic concepts, e.g. how to calculate Naive bayes prediction from scratch and how to manuall calculate the output of a simple Neural Network. 

✅ I really liked Supplement B which has a detailed and simple-to-understand explanations on how to calculate partial derivatives for different loss functions for gradient descent;

### Negative aspects

❌ The final project in Chapter 13 is an excellent starting point for a beginner, but it definitely is not implemented perfectly and requires further work and code refactoring, if we scrutinise it more.

❌ The ML module used in the book to create many models - `turicreate` - doesn't work! I couldn't get to use it no matter which version of python I used.

❌ I have found the book to have quite a lot of mistakes!
